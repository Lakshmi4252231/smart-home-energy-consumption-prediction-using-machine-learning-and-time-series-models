The increasing use of smart meters in residential environments has generated large volumes of time-series energy consumption data, creating opportunities for intelligent energy management through accurate forecasting. Short-term energy consumption prediction is essential for optimizing household energy usage, reducing costs, and supporting grid stability.

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a predictive framework for smart home energy consumption using machine learning and time-series models. Phase 2 emphasizes the implementation, testing, and comparison of multiple computational approaches, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM neural networks. The models are evaluated using standardized error metrics to analyze performance trade-offs and establish a foundation for final refinement in Phase 3.
